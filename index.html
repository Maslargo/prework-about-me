      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I work in a button factory, working as a business analyst.  I'm fine pushing buttons, I just want to be able to push more buttons.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>My wife might say Mars, but really, I grew up in Murray, Utah.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Spending time with Betty Jo, Pondering stories from Doctor Who, and finding truth around me through critical thinking.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to run a bed and breakfast, but learning to code will do for the next 50 years.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Some would say I live in the arm pit of the Salt Lake valley in Utah, but we call it Kearns.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>With pushing more buttons comes greater responsibility, and hopefully more money.  Maybe I can help others with what I learn.</p>
